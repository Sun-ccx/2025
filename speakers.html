                        Title: AIoT Technology for Power Sector: Design and Application<br>
                       The power sector provides fundamental utility services such as water, electricity, gas, cooling, and heating to the industrial park, consuming nearly half of the park’s energy. Therefore, achieving low- carbon operation in the power sector holds significant significance for energy efficiency in the industrial park. In this presentation, we will delve into the current operational status of the power sector and share our experiences and case studies in achieving efficient energy management and low-carbon operation by exploiting AIoT.<br><br>

                       Title: Leveraging Cyberworld and AI Technologies for Gender Equality<br>
                       Gender equality is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but achieving this target by 2030 remains challenging for most countries. In Japan, technology sectors such as ICT and the automobile industry face a significant shortage of women in their workforce, a problem that cannot be resolved by individual companies alone. In 2013, the Japan Association of Technology Executives (JAOTE) issued a report advocating for affirmative actions to address this issue. However, progress has been slow. Given this situation, could the rapidly advancing technologies of the cyberworld and AI contribute more effectively to achieving gender equality, including increasing the number of female engineers? Currently, these technologies present both positive and negative aspects. The disadvantages are particularly notable due to biases in historical data and a lack of diversity among developers. However, there is potential to leverage these technologies to tackle social issues like gender equality. Proactive utilization of these technologies, while addressing new challenges, is desired. Which goals should we prioritize? What approaches can we take? This discussion will explore the potential of cyberworld and AI technologies in promoting gender equality from this perspective.<br><br>
                       Prof. Hideko S. Kunii, Ph.D. is a Visiting Professor at Shibaura Institute of Technology and a director of INCJ, Ltd. She has served as the first female director at several major corporations including Honda Motor Co., Ltd., Tokyo Electric Power Holdings Inc. and Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation. She had a longstanding career at Ricoh Company, Ltd., Tokyo Japan, where she held various positions including Chairperson of Ricoh IT Solutions Co. Ltd. and Corporate Senior Vice President. During her tenure at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, she served as the Deputy President and General Manager of the Gender Equality Promotion Office, as well as a Professor at the Graduate School of Engineering Management. <br><br>

                       Title: JIZAI Body: beyond human limits<br>
                       The social revolutions have accompanied innovation of the view of the body. If we regard the information revolution as establishment of a virtual society against the real society, it is necessary to design a new view of body “JIZAI body (Virtual Cyborg),” which can adapt freely to the change of social structure, and establish a new view of the body. In this talk, we discuss how we understand of basic knowledge about the body editing for construction of JIZAI body (Virtual Cyborg) based on VR, AR and Robotics. Superhuman Sports: Applying Human Augmentation to Physical Exercise.<br><br>
                      Prof. Masahiko Inami took up his current position as professor at the University of Tokyo after working at the University of Electro-Communications and Keio University. His interests include “JIZAI body editing technology,” the Augmented Human, and entertainment engineering. He has received several awards, including TIME Magazine’s “Coolest Invention of the Year” award and the Young Scientist Award and Research Category Award from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT). He is also a director of the Information Processing Society of Japan, a director of the Virtual Reality Society of Japan, and a member of the Science Council of Japan. His latest book is called “Theory of JIZAI Body” (Springer, 2023). <br><br>
